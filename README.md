# AgenticAISurveyDetection
This repository includes a guide and the code to detect the use of Comet Agentic AI browsers to take Qualtrics surveys. The detection code looks for use of the Comet browser in terms of Detecting Comet’s blue DOM theme using JavaScript + Embedded Data. The HTML code uses an invisible HTML phrase (“snow bicycle”) that only AI will see.

Please read the Guide here - https://github.com/BrandPhD/AgenticAISurveyDetection/blob/9c338d54444dab08bf6378daa985a6376c46bceb/Guide%20to%20Flagging%20Agentic%20AI%20(Comet)%20in%20Online%20Surveys.pdf
